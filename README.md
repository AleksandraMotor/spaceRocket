## General Information

  The program creates rockets from parts. Using various materials, you can create your dream rocket to conquer space or blow up your enemies.
  
  The "spaceRocket" program creates rockets from parts. Using various materials, you can create your dream rocket to conquer space or blow up your enemies.

  For the sake of the environment, we use biodegradable materials, such as sugar cane plastic, and our rockets are powered by biofuel!

  Using the "Builder" design pattern, we created an application that allows you to build a rocket tailored to your individual needs.
  The builder is a creative design pattern that gives the ability to create complex objects step by step. This pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
